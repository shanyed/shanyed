    <p>
      Welcome to my new page. <br>
      After putting it off for a whole year, I’m finally starting the English section.
      Before settling into the flow of research, I didn’t quite know how to put my thoughts into words.
      I only got the idea to start jotting things down while waiting for one of my submitted papers to be reviewed.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this blog, I plan to share bits and pieces of my Ph.D. journey and my thoughts on doing research—maybe even
      sprinkling in a few tips along the way if they seem helpful. And, as the Feynman Technique also suggests, the best
      way to test whether you truly understand something is to teach it to someone else.
      Just last weekend, my master’s supervisor asked me to give a talk to some junior students in clinical medicine
      about how
      to do research and some basic statistics.That’s when it hit me—grand life advice from our elders doesn’t
      always solve the concrete challenges we face today.
      Sometimes, hearing from someone who’s actually walked the path and knows its twists and turns can be the best way
      to avoid unnecessary detours.And if my experience can help even a little, well, that would make me genuinely
      happy.

    </p>

    <p>
      Anyway, I hope this space can serve as a bridge between exploring science and personal growth—where
      research is not just about data, but about creating meaning through lived experience.
    </p>
